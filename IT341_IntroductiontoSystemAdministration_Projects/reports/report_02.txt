Project 2 Configuring and Using a LAN.
Partner: Manny Dolce

---------------------------------------------
2022-03-03 -- Project 2 Begins:
---------------------------------------------

+ My partner and I started on project 2 after the professor's lecture on 
security. Before we got started o the preliminary steps for project 2, we ran 
a command to specify the text file that we named Project2.txt.

+ After this we began running the codes necessary to fulfill the preliminary 
steps. On step "g" during this process, we were able to confirm that we have 
both ens33 lo after running the following command:
	ip addr show
	~ This command was executed successfully.

+ On step "I", after accessing the file, there were no prior comments in the nano
file, therefore we had to add the following contents to the nano file: 
	auto lo
	iface lo inet loopback
	auto ens33
	iface ens33 inet dhcp
	~ This command was executed successfully.

+ After running "sudo reboot", it stopped our script that was saving our 
outputs. Before we continued, my partner and I reran a second script to save 
the CLI outputs, named; project2_pt2.txt. 

+ After this the class period had finished, however, we continued until we
finished the primary part 1 Tasks. During this process we got stuck on step 4, 
however, we figured it out with the professor's help. We used PowerShell and 
notepad to copy and paste the 64 lines of code in groups of 16 because the 
machine can only handle that amount at a time. We did this for a total of 64 
lines. 
	- We ended at step 4 where we logged out of our VM and shut it down. 

														------END OF CLASS------


---------------------------------------------
2022-03-24 -- Project 2 Continued:
---------------------------------------------


+ Proceeding after spring break, we continued where we had left off which was 
on step 5 of the preliminary task. Following this, we changed our network settings 
so that they bridge which connects us directly to the physical network.

+ After this occurrence, within the same dialog box we changed our mac address 
as stated in the instructions. 
	- We were unable to change the letters in the MAC address to lowercase as 
	seen in the instructions

+ With our new MAC, we powered up the machine once again. Before continuing 
we ran a script called project2_continued.txt where we could continue to save all 
of our outputs. 

+ After a command that copied the interfaces file into our directory.
	- Then we edited the interfaces file as stated and input the IP address 
	  for our machine.
	sudo cp /etc/network/interfaces /etc/network/interfaces.saved
	~ This command was executed sucessfully.

+ We could not ssh into some other VMS since we did not have the proper 
credentials. 

+ Now we have completed part 1 of project 2 leaving us at step 14; shutting down,
or logging off the machine. 

														------END OF CLASS------


---------------------------------------------
2022-04-05 -- Project 2 Continued:
---------------------------------------------
+ From this point on we both were able to remotely connect to our virtual machine
as long as we keep it running in the lab. We can do this by running the following
commands and entering in the passwords; 
	ssh it341@10.200.6.58
	Unix password: 
	ssh sysadmin@itvm25-2b
	yes
	sysadmin password:
	~ This command was executed successfully.

	sudo apt-get update
	~ This command was executed successfully.

	sudo apt-get install nis
	~ This command was executed successfully.

+ Following the instructions, next we needed to download and install NIS. To do 
this we stared by getting the right apt repositories by runniing the following;
	sudo scp it341@10.0.0.1:/home/ckelly/it341_files/sources.list 
	/etc/apt/sources.list
	~ This command was executed sucessfully.

+ The file located in /etc/nsswitch.conf also needed to be changed. To do this 
we ran... 
	sudo nano /etc/nsswitch.conf
	~ This command was executed successfully.

	Then added the following content;
	passwd: files systemd nis
	group: files systemd nis
	shadow: files nis
	gshadow: files
	hosts: dns files nis

+ On the virtual machine we also needed to add a home directory for my partner 
and I. We did this by running the following command; 
	sudo mkdir /home/aj092000

+ Next, we saw the professor, on the it20 side to add a new user  account. He 
ran the following commands to do so; 
	sudo adduser --no-create-home aj092000
	cd /var/yp
	sudo make
	sudo sysv-rc-conf ypbind on

+ Once this was accomplished we used su sysadmin, to exit from sysadmin's 
the session, and land back in the session with my individual account thus, 
completing project 2.

2022-04-21 -- Continue - DISCUSSION Q&A:
---------------------------------------------

1. What is the IP address of the gateway server...
	- For your virtual machine?
	- For your physical host?

Answer: 

+ The IP address of my virtual machine's gateway server is 10.0.0.1. The IP 
address of my physical host's gateway server is 172.17.0.1

2. What is the IP address...
	- Of your VM?
	- Of your physical host?

Answer:

+ The IP address of my virtual machine is 10.0.0.159. The IP address of my 
physical host is 172.17.29.196.

3. Explain how you found out all of these things, for both the VM and the 
physical host. (NOTE: The /etc/hosts file is not a valid source for answering 
either of the preceding questions!)

Answer:

+ You can find out all of these things by running the following command; 
arp -a

4. What is DHCP, and why do we use DHCP? Please explain.

Answer:

+ Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) is a network management protocol 
used to automate the process of configuring devices on IP networks, thus 
allowing them to use network services such as DNS, NTP, and any communication 
protocol based on UDP or TCP. A DHCP server dynamically assigns an IP address 
and other network configuration parameters to each device on a network so they
can communicate with other IP networks.

5. What is NAT (Network Address Translation), and why do we use it? Please 
explain.

Answer: 

+ It’s a way to map multiple local private addresses to a public one before 
transferring the information. Whenever we want multiple devices to 
employ a single IP address, we use NAT. 
Source: https://www.comptia.org/content/guides/what-is-network-address-
translation

6. Use Google to search the Internet to find how you can make Ubuntu Server do 
this NAT and
implement the required DHCP.

	- Choose the clearest explanation and make a citation of the webpage. 
	Include as much
citation information as you can:
		* Author's name
		* Article/page name
		* Date of publication
		* Name of the overall website
		* URL for the specific page
	
	- I should be able to enter the URL and land directly on the page
		* At the very least, you should be able to provide a title and URL
		* The citation itself goes here, as your main answer to question #6.
		* Copy the text of the article/page/explanation, but you will not paste 
		it until the very
	end of your lab report, AFTER your answers to all the other discussion 
	questions.

7. What is the hosts file, and what does it do?

Answer:

+ A Hosts file is a file that almost all computers and operating systems can use
to map a connection between an IP address and domain names. This file is an 
ASCII text file. It contains IP addresses separated by a space and then a 
domain name. Each address gets its own line.

8. Please define and explain the networking settings of "NAT" and "bridged" 
in VMWare. In a previous question, you discussed NAT more generally, but now you
need to discuss it in the context of VMs in VMWare, specifically.

Answer:

+ Bridging is a network term that describes extending a network without using a 
router. When you place your virtual machine's virtual network adapter into 
bridged mode, your local wired or wireless network is effectively extended to 
your virtual machine. Your virtual machine becomes a peer of all the other 
computers on that network. NAT is a network technology that protects one network
from another. it protects your Mac by preventing unknown computers on the 
Internet from connecting directly to it.

9. Now is a good time to read about – and experiment with – these tools and 
utilities for network
troubleshooting:
	a. ping (again)
	b. ifconfig
	c. route
	d. traceroute
	e. netstat

Write about these, based upon
❖ Your reading
• The Petersen textbook
• The man pages for each utility
• Sources found by searching Google
❖ Your tests/experiments during Project 2.

Answer:

+ ping
Verifies IP-level connectivity to another TCP/IP computer by sending Internet 
Control Message Protocol (ICMP) echo request messages. The receipt of 
corresponding echo Reply messages are displayed, along with round-trip times. 
ping is the primary TCP/IP command used to troubleshoot connectivity, 
reachability, and name resolution. Used without parameters, this command 
displays Help content.
 Source: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows
-commands/ping

+ ifconfig
Configures or displays network interface parameters for a network by using 
TCP/IP. You can use the ifconfig command to assign an address to a network 
interface and to configure or display the current network interface 
configuration information. The ifconfig command must be used at system startup 
to define the network address of each interface present on a system. After 
system startup, it can also be used to redefine an interfaces address and its 
other operating parameters. The network interface configuration is held on the 
running system and must be reset at each system restart. The ifconfig command 
interprets the IFF_MULTICAST flag and prints its value if it is set.
 Source: https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/aix/7.2?topic=i-ifconfig-command

+ route
Manually manipulates the routing tables. The route command allows you to make 
manual entries into the network routing tables. The route command distinguishes 
between routes to hosts and routes to networks by interpreting the network 
address of the Destination variable, which can be specified either by symbolic 
name or a numeric address. The route command resolves all symbolic names into 
addresses, using either the /etc/hosts file or the network name server. 
 Source: https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/aix/7.2?topic=r-route-command

+ traceroute
The Trace TCP/IP Route (TRCTCPRTE) command, also known as TRACEROUTE, traces the
route of IP packets to a user-specified destination system. The route can 
involve many different systems along the way. Each system along the route is 
referred to as a hop. You can trace all hops along the route or specify the 
starting and ending hops to be traced. The route is traced by sending packets 
(called probes) to the destination system. Each probe contains an upper limit 
(called Time To Live or TTL) on the number of hop systems the probe can pass 
through.

10. On your VM, what aspect of the /etc/default/nis file differs from that 
which was given in the On The Clients section of the second half of Project 2? 
What does that difference mean, and/or is it significant for our purposes? 
(NOTE: This question has nothing to do with the /etc/default/nis file on it20, 
which is another issue entirely.)

Answer:

+ On our vm the aspect of the /etc/default/nis file that differs from that 
which was given in the On The Clients section of the second half of Project 2 
from the following 2 entries; 
Started off as NISSERVER=master. After the change it was NISSERVER=false

There are three types of NIS machines; Master servers, Slave servers, and Clients 
of NIS servers. Any machine can be a NIS client, but only machines with disks 
should be NIS servers, either master or slave. Servers are also clients, 
typically of themselves.

11. The su command: What does "su" stand for, and what is the command's purpose?

Answer: 

+ The Unix command su, which stands for 'substitute user' 
(originally 'superuser'), is used by a computer user to execute commands with 
the privileges of another user account. When executed it invokes a shell without
changing the current working directory or the user environment.
Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Su_(Unix)

12. Why do we often need to restart the VM – or at least restart some specific 
service – after installing some software or making some changes to the config

Answer:

+ A restart is required because the task of replacing files cannot be done when 
they are being used by the operating system or other applications.


Question #6. Explanation; 

Answer:

+ The setup is simple: a single Ubuntu server will act as a gateway and DHCP 
server for a local network. All other machines on the local network will receive 
their IPs from the DHCP server. To make things easier, I’ll call this Ubuntu 
server “Skyray” for the rest of the post.

Skyray has two network interfaces, eth0, and eth1. eth0 is on the 10.20.30.0/24 
subnet and this is the Internet-facing interface. eth1 is on the 172.22.22.0/24
 subnet, where all other machines are also present. Basically, eth0 will connect
  to the Internet, and eth1 will serve DHCP requests and act as the gateway.
/etc/network/interfaces

First, you need to configure eth0 and eth1 for Skyray. Edit the file and make 
sure it has at least the following settings (or whatever settings are 
appropriate for your environment).

sudo vim /etc/network/interfaces

auto lo
iface lo inet loopback

auto eth0
iface eth0 inet static
    address 10.20.30.77
    netmask 255.255.255.0
    gateway 10.20.30.1
    network 10.20.30.0
    broadcast 10.20.30.255
    dns-nameservers 10.20.30.15 10.20.30.16
    dns-search codeghar.com

auto eth1
iface eth1 inet static
    address 172.22.22.1
    netmask 255.255.255.0
    network 172.22.22.0
    broadcast 172.22.22.255

/etc/sysctl.conf

You need to enable IPv4 forwarding. To do so, edit this file.

sudo vim /etc/sysctl.conf

And uncomment the line

# net.ipv4.ip_forward=1

so that it now appears as

net.ipv4.ip_forward=1

Save the file and run the following command to make the change effective without 
a reboot.

sudo sysctl -w net.ipv4.ip_forward=1
/etc/rc.local

You’ll need to allow iptables rules for NAT to work. Edit the file and save it.

sudo vim /etc/rc.local

Make sure the following two lines appear before the exit 0 line in the file.

/sbin/iptables -P FORWARD ACCEPT
/sbin/iptables --table nat -A POSTROUTING -o eth0 -j MASQUERADE

To make these iptables rules active without rebooting, run the following 
commands:

sudo iptables -P FORWARD ACCEPT

sudo iptables –-table nat -A POSTROUTING -o eth0 -j MASQUERADE
Install DHCP server

sudo aptitude install isc-dhcp-server
/etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf

Configure your newly installed DHCP server. Edit the file and save.

sudo vim /etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf

The file is very well commented and you can learn a lot reading it. Just make 
sure it has at least the following configuration.

ddns-update-style none;

# option definitions common to all supported networks...
option domain-name "codeghar.com";
option domain-name-servers 10.20.30.15, 10.20.30.16;

default-lease-time 3600;
max-lease-time 7200;

# If this DHCP server is the official DHCP server for the local
# network, the authoritative directive should be uncommented.
authoritative;

# Use this to send dhcp log messages to a different log file (you also
# have to hack syslog.conf to complete the redirection).
log-facility local7;

# This is a very basic subnet declaration.

subnet 172.22.22.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 {
  range 172.22.22.21 172.22.22.250;
  option subnet-mask 255.255.255.0;
  option broadcast-address 172.22.22.255;
  option routers 172.22.22.1;
}

/etc/default/isc-dhcp-server

We want to serve DHCP only on eth1 interface to we need to configure it that 
way. Edit the file and save it.

sudo vim /etc/default/isc-dhcp-server

The line will look like this before you change it

INTERFACES=""

And after you change it, it will look like this:

INTERFACES="eth1"

Now you should stop and start the DHCP server.

sudo service isc-dhcp-server stop (if the service is already running; skip if 
it’s not running)

sudo service isc-dhcp-server start
Conclusion

Now any machines you have on the 172.22.22.0/24 network will get their IP 
address from Skyray if they are set to DHCP. And Skyray will also serve as 
their gateway.
