Project 1 Installing Ubuntu Server on a Virtual Machine.
Partner: Manny Dolce

---------------------------------------------
2022-03-01 -- 19:25:43 Project 1 Begin:
---------------------------------------------

+ Throughout the duration of this project, we will be installing Ubuntu 20.04 
LTS Server on our VMware virtual machine. 
	- We were assigned it25 as our physical machine workstation and itvm25-2b as 
	the virtual machine Hostname. 

+ We started this project off with the creation of the virtual machine on the 
VMWare Workstation.
 	- This was achieved by proceeding through the new virtual machine wizard 
 	selecting; The "typical" method for installation, "I will install the 
 	operating system later", to install a "Linux" operating system using a 
 	"Ubuntu 64 -bit" version. After this we needed to set the default hostname 
 	to itvm25-2b and location to the appropriate directory to store our virtual 
 	machine: 
 		{C:/IT341/section2b} ~ Machine it25

+ Next, we formatted the drive.  
	- To accomplish this we selected "Split virtual disk into multiple files" 
	with 20 GB of maximum disk size. All of the other hardware defaults were not 
	customized in this process and left untouched. 

+ Then, we loaded our ISO image into our CD/DVD drive. 
	- This was accomplished by setting the CD/DVD (SATA) to auto-detect and 
	using a specific file path to source it; 
		{C:\OS ISOs\Linux\Ubuntu\LTS\Server\ubuntu-20.04.1-live-server-amd64.iso}

+ After configuring all of the prerequisites, powering on the machine led to a 
prompt to start a step-by-step installation process. 
	- We continued with the following preferences selected; "English" for 
	language, "Continue without updating", "English (US)" for Layout and Variant
	, "Use an entire disk", and Unchecking the LVM option. 
	- Next, we were prompted for our profile setup where we used "sysadmin" as a 
	USERNAME and "itvm25-2b" as a PASSWORD. 
	- We let the installer run it's course until it finished and prompted us to 
	"Reboot now". Once this was finished we removed the ISO from the CD/DVD 
	drive then rebooted the system. This will prevent it from autobooting upon 
	restart.

2022-03-03 -- 19:40:59 - Project 1 Continue:
---------------------------------------------

+  At this point we will be finishing up project 1. In order to accomplish this 
goal today, we will need to check the network and internet connection as well as 
install specific software. 
	- After finishing the installation processes we logged in as sysadmin and 
	started a script file to record the commands and outputs. Now that we logged 
	in and started a script file, we began to run the ping command with 5 
	packets to see if we can connect to the outside world. The following command 
	was executed successfully. 
		{ping -c 5 www.yahoo.com}

+ Now that we ensured that we have a connection to the outside world we need to 
update and upgrade Ubuntu since we skipped this step in the installation process 
and because of security and operating system improvements since version 20.04 
was released. At this point there we need to use the root “superuser do" command 
in order to have full privileges to alter the operating system's files. 
	- To do this we entered the following commands; 
	
	{sudo systemctl disable apt-daily.service}	
	~ After inputing sysadmin password this command was executed sucessfully. 
	
	{sudo systemctl disable} 
	~ This command was executed sucessfully.
	
	{sudo systemctl disable apt-daily.timer} 
	~ This command was executed sucessfully.
	
	{sudo systemctl disable} 
	~ This command was executed sucessfully.
	
	{sudo apt-get update} 
	~ This command was executed sucessfully to update the catalog.

	{sudo apt-get upgrade} 
	~ This command was executed sucessfully after Choosing Y to continue.

	{sudo apt-get install openssh-server} 
	~ This command was executed sucessfully after Choosing Y to continue.

+ With the successful execution of the previous commands, we ended the script 
file and logged out of the virtual machine. 
	- At this point, we created our first snapshot titled "Project 1 - Complete."
	Snapshots are used to represent the Virtual machines state at various 
	points in time. This Snapshot will be used for the following project as a 
	restore point to recover our machine whenever necessary, specifically if the
	 system fails. Our Snapshot was named itvm25-2b-Snapshot1 and it was stored 
	 in the following location; 
	{C:/IT341/section2b}

2022-03-03 -- Continue - DISCUSSION Q&A:
---------------------------------------------

1. What does LTS stand for, and what does that mean? Please
explain.

	+ LTS stands for long-term support. Here, support means that throughout the 
	lifetime of a release there is a commitment to update, patch, and maintain 
	the software. "For an LTS, there is a shorter development cycle, where 
	engineers and contributors add to the body of the release. And a longer beta
	 testing cycle, where more testing and bug fixing takes place to focus on a 
	 release’s performance and stability." Ubuntu is released by Canonical every 
	 six months, and it's Long Term Support version is released every two years.

2. What is an LVM? (It stands for "logical volume manager".)
Please explain what a logical volume is and what a logical
volume manager does.

	+ Logical volume management provides a higher-level view of the disk storage
	 on a computer system than the traditional view of disks and partitions. 
	 This gives the system administrator much more flexibility in allocating 
	 storage to applications and users. Storage volumes created under the 
	 control of the logical volume manager can be resized and moved around 
	 almost at will, although this may need some upgrading of file system tools.
	 "The logical volume manager also allows the management of storage volumes 
	 in user-defined groups, allowing the system administrator to deal with 
	 sensibly named volume groups." This command can be vary dangerous if not 
	 used responsibly.

3. Please explain what the Sudo command is, how it is used, and
why we need it.

	+ The sudo command or "super user do", allows you to run programs with the 
	security privileges of another user (by default, as the superuser). 
	It prompts you for your password and confirms your request to execute a 
	command by checking a file, called sudoers, which the system administrator 
	configures. "Using the sudoers file, system administrators can give certain 
	users or groups access to some or all commands without those users having to 
	know the root password." It also logs all commands and arguments so there is 
	a record of who used it for what, and when.

4. Please explain what apt-get is and why we use it.

	+ apt-get is a command-line tool that helps in handling packages in Linux. 
	It's main task is to retrieve the information and packages from the 
	authenticated sources for installation, upgrade, and removal of packages 
	along with their dependencies.

5. Please explain what "snapshots" are and why they are useful to
us.

	+ In computer systems, a snapshot is the state of a system at a particular 
	point in time. "The term was coined as an analogy to that in photography. 
	It can refer to an actual copy of the state of a system or a capability 
	provided by certain systems at a point in time." Snapshots are useful 
	because they can restore a system from a point in time during an event of 
	failure or unstableness. This is why they are usful for us.
