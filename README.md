 University of Massachusetts Boston IT Coursework

This repository features my top coursework from UMass Boston IT classes, including programming projects, data analysis, and database development assignments. These works showcase my expertise in various IT concepts and programming languages, demonstrating my skills in critical thinking and problem-solving. I hope this repository can serve as a useful resource for fellow students and anyone interested in the field of IT.


IT 230L  Relational Databases
Description:
This course provides a thorough review of basic relational database concepts and how to apply these concepts to a variety of application problems. The course focuses on the use and properties of relational database management systems. Topics covered include DBMS architecture levels, data modeling, data definition and manipulation capabilities of Structured Query Language programming, and programming techniques for accessing relational databases.

IT 341  Introduction to System Administration
Description:
This is an introduction to the process of choosing, installing, configuring, and maintaining UNIX operating systems such as Linux. Topics include user management, file system management, security, networked file systems (NFS), networked information systems (NIS), domain name servers (DNS), mail systems and printers. Students will get practice writing shell scripts. Also, students are introduced to general systems administration policy. 

IT 415 Advanced Coding for Analytics
Description:
An increasing number of businesses are seeing values in data and seeking talents for data analytics. This course aims to teach how the write codes to implement data pre-processing, machine learning models, predictive analysis, and visualization. Useful packages that are closely related to analytics will be introduced to equip students with necessary toolkits for processing and analyzing data. The course is designed to train students as experts in analytics with sufficient coding skills.

IT 425L  Project Management
Description:
Covers techniques and managerial concepts of project management. This course prepares students to manage either complex physical projects or complex software development projects. Topics presented in this course include project life cycles, economic analysis of projects, work breakdown structure, cost estimation, and the scheduling, staffing, directing, and controlling of projects. The course also covers the use of management science techniques and computer software for project management. 

IT 485 Capstone
Description:
Students will work on a semester-long project, particular to their track and meet together with an instructor and with students from other tracks to discuss each other's projects. Students will deliver a product that is appropriate to their track in the IT program. At the end of the semester, students report on their product, both in oral presentations and demonstrations and in writing.

IT 461L  Systems Analysis and Design
Description:
Introduces recent approaches to the analysis and design of computer information systems, including the hands-on use of computer aided software engineering (CASE) tools. The changing role of the systems analyst in both operations and systems applications in today's organizations is examined. The course critically analyzes systems development methodologies, including life cycle models and prototyping; reviews user-led developments and current approaches which facilitate user-developer collaboration; discusses effective diagramming and notational techniques now available to define and document functional requirements and operational business processes; and examines current methods used to test and evaluate the accuracy, completeness, and usability of documented requirements and convert them into efficient systems design or re-engineering processes. Topics include CASE tools, module and transaction design, human-computer interfaces, and system configuration. This course includes practical experience in analyzing and designing an organizational application. It discusses the concept of quality as applied to information systems and business process redesign as well as the role of information systems in managing quality within an organization.   

IT 471  Data Warehousing
Description:
this course provides students with the technical skills required to plan and implement a data warehouse using a database management system. It describes basic data warehousing concepts. The course covers design and implementation of data marts and operational data stores. This course involves designing a data warehousing system and the implementation of a database with a stare schema, gathering data from primary data sources, transforming data, and loading it into a database management system. Students create cubes using OLAP and analyze cube data using client application.
